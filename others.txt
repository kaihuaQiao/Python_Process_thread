 Is this the right room for an argument?

 I've told you once.

 No you haven't!

 Yes I have.

 When?

 Just now.

 No you didn't!

 Yes I did!

 You didn't!

 I'm telling you, I did!

 You did not!

 Oh I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?

 Ah! (taking out his wallet and paying) Just the five minutes.

 Just the five minutes. Thank you.

 Anyway, I did.

 You most certainly did not!

 Now let's get one thing quite clear: I most definitely told you!

 Oh no you didn't!

 Oh yes I did!

 Oh no you didn't!

 Oh yes I did!

 Oh look, this isn't an argument!
